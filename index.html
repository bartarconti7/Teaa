        <p>Taiwanese oolong can be light-fermented or medium-fermented—its fermentation level can vary from 8% to 70%, which exemplifies the tea’s diversity. After brief roasting, the tea leaves are rolled into a semi-spherical shape. Taken from the Wuyi Mountains, Taiwan’s oolong plants are more closely related to the style of Northern Fujian Wuyi tea. Also, the brewed Taiwanese oolong tea is usually amber in colour, bearing little resemblance to the yellow-green or pastel yellow Fujian oolong.</p>

        <h1 id="industry">Taiwanese Tea Industry</h1>
    
        <p>Currently, there are about 20,000 ha of tea farms in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" target="_blank">Taiwan</a></span>, producing about 20,000 tons of tea in every year, mainly distributing in Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Nantou, ChiaI, Yunlin, Kaohsiung, Taitung, Hualien and Ilan counties. The tea industry in Taiwan was export-oriented in the past. Tea exports reached a high record of 23,516 tons. Tea exports were on the decline over the years. Tea exports were 2,592 tons in 2002. The sustainable increase of domestic consumption is due to economic prosperity and the rising level of living standards as well as to the increasing consumption. Though tea farms are diminishing gradually, the qualities of Taiwan tea are highly appreciated by domestic and international markets. Carrying tea as a gift when traveling abroad is very popular.
            　 The types of teas produced in Taiwan include green tea, Paochong tea, Oolong tea and black tea. In order to meet consumers’ demands, major types of teas produced currently in Taiwan are Paochong tea and Oolong tea. Black tea and green tea are minor types.

            <h1 id="flavor">Flavor Profile</h1>
             <p>Once you've tasted a fine grade of High Mountain Oolong, properly prepared the traditional Chinese way, you will know exactly what makes it so special. This tea delivers a bouquet of flavors that clearly speaks for itself the moment it touches your tongue and wafts through your nose, creating tastes and after-tastes, tones and over-tones, that cannot be faked or imitated by less well bred teas. A sip of freshly poured High Mountain Oolong introduces itself quietly in the mouth with a dry, slightly astringent foretaste which instantly clears the palate of all other residual flavors. As soon as the sip is swallowed, its marvelous floral aftertaste blooms quickly on the tongue and expands aromatically into the throat and sinuses, unfolding like the fumes of a fragrant flower. This is a very hard act for any other tea to follow, and many tea drinkers become lifelong devotees of High Mountain Oolong after trying it for the first time.</p>
